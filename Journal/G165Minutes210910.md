# G165 Minutes 21.09.10

**Attending:** Vega Carlson (Virtually), Kaleb McQuillan, Reid Zimmerman, Cole Sirokman

---

**What you've done:**

Vega:

- [ ] Figure out bus structure and choose μC for sequncer - by Friday, September 10th 2021  

  NOTE: Vega was sick most of the week, task moved to next week.

  He did think about the processor that would be used, and he suggested using a Raspberry Pi because it helps us have a lot of different processes happening in real time. 

Kaleb:

- [ ] Simulate an Attack/Decay envelope gen - by Friday, September 10th 2021

  Found some circuits that seem like they will work. Simulations have been difficult because he is doing them in LTSpice, where libraries can be a little difficult. He says he is confident in his circuit though. 

Reid:

- [x] Simulate Snare Drum using LiveSpice by Friday, September 10th 2021

  Snare Drum simulations were difficult because simulation software tends to remove white noise, so the waveforms were not perfect. 

Cole:

- [ ] Simulate Toms using LiveSpice - by Friday, September 10th 2021

  Simulated in LiveSpice. Set up was a little funky, so he is going to try to work with it more this week.
