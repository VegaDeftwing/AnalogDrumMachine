# Vega Carlson - Group 165 - Fall '21, Week 1

## Monday, Aug 2nd W:1.5 T:1.5 

**1.5 hr** coming up with ideas and thinking about feasibility. Ideas included an envelope generator with per-stage modulation and smooth transitions, a VGA based video effect synthesizer combining digital generation with analog feedback, a wavetable oscillator with either a germanium or VFD based distortion stage, a MIDI controller implementing some of the MIDI 2.0 spec, an analog drum machine, a digital drum machine, a plotter to draw generative art generated by the Î¼C, and an IOT device with analog gauges and small OLED screens. Each of these would be somewhat based on prior art. Respectively, the [XAOC Zadar](http://xaocdevices.com/main/zadar/); the [Pimoroni RPPico Board](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/pimoroni-pico-vga-demo-base) and [Sleepy Circuits Hypno](https://sleepycircuits.com/hypno); [Various past examples of using a VFD as an amplifer](https://hackaday.com/2013/11/09/vfd-display-becomes-an-amplifier/); [The MIDI 2.0 spec](https://www.midi.org/specifications/midi-2-0-specifications)'s significantly greater capabilities; the [TR-808 drum machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roland_TR-808); the [Elektron Digitakt Drum Machine](https://www.elektron.se/products/digitakt/); [The Plotter Art subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/PlotterArt/); and the [Quirky Nibus](https://www.wink.com/downloads/help/quirkyge-nimbus-digital-dashboard-and-clock/user-guide.pdf). 

## Tuesday, Aug 3rd -- W:5 T:5

**1.5 hr** forming our group, going though the above listed ideas and narrowing the selection down to our main choice, the analog drum machine, and a backup, the VGA synth. Some time was spent explaining the basic concept of what a drum machine is to the group, providing context on how a potential high level design may work for this class, etc.

**2hr** getting the analog drum machine concept off the ground, and getting resources prepared to show the rest of the group and better explain the concept I had in mind. A tentative, high level feature list was made and a concept sketch produced:

This was also uploaded to github: [https://github.com/VegaDeftwing/AnalogDrumMachine](https://github.com/VegaDeftwing/AnalogDrumMachine)

## Wednesday, Aug 4th -- W:7.25 T:7.25

**1hr** Refinements of the concept sketch and feature list

**1hr** Some research was also done looking into potential circuits. I dove into Bucket Brigade Chips pretty hard, looking for what might be needed to implement Karplus Strong Synthesis, I found [this page about BBD circuits](http://www.sdiy.org/BBDHell/BBD-Manual.pdf) with some reference implementations and data about some of the most common ICs.

**15min** explaining to the group how what is normally called distortion in the music world is just "squaring up" a signal, adding harmonics
