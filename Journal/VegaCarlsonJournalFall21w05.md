## Monday, Sep 20th -- W:6.00 T:37.0

**2.0hr** -- Worked with the rest of the group testing circuits in the Sr. Design Lab. We got the snare drum output working, though it sounds more like a hi-hat. The Bass durm was having odd issues. We think it might just need re-wired with better breadboard wires as wiggling some connections seemed to change things.
