## What We've Done

Inital tasks have been assigned and will be reported on in Friday's Minutes

## Minutes

11:00 - Start of Meeting

11:07 - Discussion on how to take minutes. Format as proposed is identical to as perviously submitted except that action items should have percise dates, not just relative.

11:10 - Discussion about historical storage media

11:22 - Discussion about the project as proposed, including potential changes such as using a RaspberryPi and touch screen or e-ink instead of an OLED

11:30 - Remainder of time spent disussing DLP and LCD projector technology, sparked by conversation of "What is this part?" in regards to the micromirror device on the table
