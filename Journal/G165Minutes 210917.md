# G165 Minutes 21.09.17

**Attending:** Vega Carlson, Kaleb McQuillan, Reid Zimmerman, Cole Sirokman

---

**What you've done:**

**Vega:**

- [x] Continue bus structure and μC selection for sequncer - by Friday, September 17th 2021

> Worked with Pi-Pico to determine what micro controller to use

Kaleb:

- [ ] Breadboard AR envelope gen - by Friday, September 17th 2021

> Was able to simulate, but not breadboard - which is actually probably better

Simulated an envelope generator circuit, and working on simulating a VCA. Also working on understanding bass drum circuits.

Reid:

- [x] Breadboard snare circuit using LiveSpice by Friday, September 17th 2021

Hasn't done much since Wednesday, worked on breadboarding snare earlier this week

Cole:

- [x] Breadboard 808 kick and toms - by Friday, September 17th 2021

  > Done, but needs some debugging

Built the Bridged-T osc with decay and freq control

## Minutes

4:20 Start of meeting, discussion about what we've done this week

4:25 Discussion about Kaleb's envelope generator, exp/lin/log envelopes

4:35 Discussion about decay/attack times for certain drums

4:44 Parts list discussion, we want to do it shopping list style- just add a check box for what's needed and check off when it's here

4:45 getting all on same page about I2C us

4:50 Looking at output of Cole's Bass drum

4:55 Planning to work on making at least one module with the bus design as planned, with the group as a whole so that we can go out and make the noise+oscilator sources for each seperately, but keep the rest of the circuit the same - Scheduled to start this Monday at ~4:00pm in the Senior Design lab

5:11 3 big goals by end of semester & skillsets

1. Drum circuit PCBs ordered
2. Ability to recive inputs from micro and display events on screen
3. Have all working analog drums on breadboard, all conected to breadboard bus, and bus taking triggers from the micro (not necessarily a sequence, but triggers even if it's just looping a test one module after the other)

Reid:

​	Comfortable with PCB design, 3D modeling, Analog circuits, C Programming

Cole:

​	Comfortable with PCB layout, decent at programming - Mostly C, a bit of music backgound

Kaleb:

​	Comfortable with simulation, some python expeniance, great at research and organization, played Bass drum in high school - understands drum tuning a bit

Vega:

​	The CS guy™- Experianced with Linux and multiple programming languages, some DSP background, used to modular synthesis (inc. drum synthesis), PCB Design, knowledge of how MIDI works, background knowledge of drum machines and the applications of different filter designs in music.

5:13 How much time has each of us put in

5:30 Who has what parts, getting a locker

## Action Items

Vega:

- [ ] UI storyboarding, high level block diagram of entire system - by Friday, September 24th 2021

Kaleb:

- [ ] Breadboard the simulated envelope generator - by Friday, September 24th 2021

Reid:
