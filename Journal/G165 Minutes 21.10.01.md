# G165 Minutes 21.10.01

**Attending:** Vega Carlson, Kaleb McQuillan, Reid Zimmerman, Cole Sirokman

---

**What you've done:**

Vega:

- [x] Get some data from the Pico to the Pi - by Friday, October 1st 2021

Kaleb:

- [x] Breadboard a couple of VCA iterations, potentially connect them to the envelope generator and test. - by Friday, October 1st 2021

Reid:

- [x] Refine the snare circuit to make it sound better - by Friday, October 1st 2021

Cole:

- [x] Clean up the base drum circuit to reduce noise distortion. - by Friday, October 1st 2021

## Minutes

2:45 Kaleb is working on improving the functionality of the VCA of the snare drum circuit. 

2:50 Reid will be researching the Atari Punk Console to implement our FM drums.

2:55 Initial testing of snare drum circuit with VCA is unsuccesful.

3:00 Vega is in the process of choosing a screen. A nicer HyperPixel screen may require using a USB audio interface that could incur additional work.

3:05 Tuning bass drum circuit to get a higher frequency tom sound. The output is distorted at high frequencies.

3:15 More testing of VCA circuit is again unsuccessful, providing a noisy output.

3:25 Everyone has a goal set for next week.
