# G165 Minutes 21.09.03

**Attending:** Vega Carlson, Kaleb McQuillan, Reid Zimmerman, Cole Sirokman

---

**What you've done:**

Vega:

- [x] Start looking into module options - by Friday, September 3rd 2021

  > Module selection - both sound generation and effects - are done. See `DrumSelection.md` and `EffectSelection.md` in the github repo. Also started figuring out what would be needed for the sequencer and the buses.

Kaleb:

- [x] Bass drum module research, finding a circuit to simulate - by Friday, September 3rd 2021

  > Looked into how a lot of the circuits work, mostly the bridged-T oscilator. Got the oscilator simulated, but not the envelope- started looking into desgins for enevolpes, using OpAmps mostly, in the hope to not just make an 808 clone.

Reid:

- [x] Trying out simulation software, finding what works best - by Friday, September 3rd 2021

  > Tried Simulink, started moving to KiCad for simulation. Still a bit unsure of what's best, but a working 808 bass drum has been made

Cole:

- [x] Bass drum module research, finding a circuit to simulate - by Friday, September 3rd 2021

  > Also simulated the 808 Bass Drum in Multisim, for sake of understanding the circuit better
