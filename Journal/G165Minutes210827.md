# G165 Minutes 21.08.27

**Attending:** Vega Carlson, Kaleb McQuillan, Reid Zimmerman, Cole Sirokman

**What you've done:**

Vega - Made intial mock up, looked into potential effects and synthesis ideas using Bucket Brigade Delays

Kaleb - Reasearched some about existing analog drum machines and past DIY projects

Reid - Read articles an drum circuits, gave feedback on mockup, exploring options for circuit simulation software

Cole - Read articles on drum machines, sequencing, etc. Looked into specific high level components (VCO, VCA, etc)
