# G165 Minutes 21.10.13

  **Attending:** Vega Carlson, Kaleb McQuillan, Reid Zimmerman, Cole Sirokman, Mark Bauer

---

  **What you've done:**

  Vega: Ordered pi hats, sorted parts

  Kaleb: Worked more with snare circuit, trying new ideas

  Reid: Made significant progress on the 2x Atari Punk Console (4x 555) circuit

  Cole: Continued work on toms, trying to work with analog mux to select caps

## Minutes

11:00 - Start of meeting

11:07 - started with talk of 3D printed cube, long dead projects namely DNA projects

11:08 - pi 3/4? use 3b+ since on hand

11:09 - Card Edge? use 2.54mm pins

11:16 - Digipots? oshpark some interposers for the SOP10 parts

11:19 - How are drums going: HiHat & Snare are complicated, trying various ideas

11:23 - Clarification on micro: need to put the rp2040 on board directly, not make a socket. The keyboards keep the solder on boards, as they're pre-made

11:30 - end of meeting
