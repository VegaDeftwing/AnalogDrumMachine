# Vega Carlson - Group 165 - Fall '21, Week 2

## Saturday, Aug 28th -- W:0.00 T:9.50

**0.00 hr** Talkd to group a bit in short intervals while they worked. Found some PDFs related to the project and sent them in our chat, but otherwise didn't do anything. Counting this as 0-time 

## Sunday, Aug 29th -- W:0.00 T:9.50

**0.00hr** Did not work on the project today

## Monday, Aug 30nd -- W:2.50 T:12.00 

**2.5 hr** Researched what drum modules would be reasonable to move forward with. As of now the plan is to make a kick drum, snare drum, hi-hat, FM-voice, Karplus-Strong (or similar) voice, sample based (SD card), Toms (with low, mid, high), and a fake-sidechained voice. More details on these choices can be found in `DrumSelection.md` in the [project's GitHub repository](https://github.com/VegaDeftwing/AnalogDrumMachine).

## Tuesday, Aug 3rd -- W:4.00 T:13.50

**1.5hr** Researched what effect modules would be best to move forward with. As of now the plan is to have fixed volume, filter, and compression effects along with delay, comb filtering, sample rate and bit-depth reduction, and distortion modules. More details on these choices can be found in `EffectSelection.md` in the [project's GitHub repository](https://github.com/VegaDeftwing/AnalogDrumMachine).
